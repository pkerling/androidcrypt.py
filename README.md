# androidcrypt.py
Mount and access encrypted user storage from Android rescue. Very useful if Android doesn't boot e.g. because of configuration issues and /data is encrypted.
Fork of androidcrypt.py with support for Android 4.4 KitKat. 
It's a quick hack job and only supports the new format without compatibility for older Android versions.
